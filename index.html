        <p> Unexpectedly, web development is slowly becoming a source of enjoyment for me. Among all my courses this semester, INFO2180 stands out as the most engaging. It's in this class that I truly feel like I'm stepping into the role of a programmer. What I appreciate most about web development is its surprising accessibility. It allows me to express my creativity while simultaneously acquiring new skills, making the learning process genuinely enjoyable. </p>
        <p>There's something compelling about understanding how complex systems are designed and built that continually draws me in. Interestingly, web development and software engineering are more closely related than one might expect. Learning to create websites has improved my grasp of larger-scale software architectures, making me more aware of design patterns and system organization from the start</p>

        <h2>My Silly Lil' Interests</h2>

        <p>Aside from computing, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy to pass the time. For one, I absolutely love skincare. However, I'm not so invested in it that I’d change my eating habits. Instead, I focus on finding the best facial and body care products to ensure I smell good and that my skin looks nice and radiant. In addition to skincare, I also enjoy watching ASMR videos. I know, I know... it’s a bit odd for most, but I find them incredibly relaxing, and they always help me fall asleep. Reading is another lovely hobby of mine, and it has become a form of escapism whenever I feel overwhelmed or stressed.</p>
